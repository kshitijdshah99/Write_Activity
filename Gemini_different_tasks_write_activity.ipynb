Try setting flush=True and see what you get. String literals in Python's print statement are primarily used to format or design how a specific string appears when printed using the print () function. \\n: This string literal is used to add a new blank line while printing a statement. \"\": An empty quote (\"\") is used to print an empty line. Or, your computer probably has a Character Viewer or something similar that lets you point and click at special characters. '\\u00a9': Use the Unicode numeric escape sequence. Google for \"unicode copyright sign\", and you'll quickly see that it's U+00A9. In Python, that's `'\\u00a9'. You can do this using the print() method of the Printing object. Here's an example: python printer.print(file='example.pdf') In this example, file is the name of the PDF file you want to print. 6. Print an image: You can also print an image using the print() method of the Printing object. Here's an example: python printer.print(image='example.jpg') Print numeric values with specified format. By specifying a format string in the replacement field {} within the string calling the format () method or in an f-string, you can format and output numeric values in any desired format.
